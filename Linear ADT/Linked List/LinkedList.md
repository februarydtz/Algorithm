## Defination
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

## Why Linked List
Most computer languages have linear data structures similar to arrays. In memory, arrays are stored in a continuous fixed-length memory grid. This is why languages such as C and Java need to define the type and length of elements stored in the array in advance when defining an array. The linked list as a dynamic sequence solves the problem of static (fixed length) arrays.
