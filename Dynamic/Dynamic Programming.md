## 0-1 Knapsack Problem
Reference: [0/1 Knapsack Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/)

Given a set of $n$ items numbered from $1$ up to $n$, each with a weight $w_i$ and a value $v_i$, along with a maximum weight capacity $Capacity$, maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.

> INPUT:<br> 
> $Capacity = 10, n = 4, V = [2,4,3,7], W = [2,3,5,5]$
